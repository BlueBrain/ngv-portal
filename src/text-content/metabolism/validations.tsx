    <p>
      Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLD signal measurement is a method in functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate neuronal activity in different brain areas based on the oxygenation levels of haemoglobin. The background theory of this method is that increased neuronal activity is associated with higher oxygen input to neurons from the blood.

      Oxygen Glucose Index.

    <p>
      OGI is a measure of relative contributions of oxidative and non-oxidative pathways to glucose consumption.

  glucose: (<div>
    <p>
      Glucose is one of the key energy substrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure shows glucose concentration dynamics in response to neuronal stimulation.

  lactate: (<div>
    <p>
      Lactate role in the brain is getting a lot of interest for both its energy substrate and regulatory roles (please see the paper's main text for details). The figure shows lactate concentration dynamics in response to neuronal stimulation.
    </p>

  nadh: (<div>
    <p>
      NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an important reducing agent in biochemical reactions. Enzymes catalysing reactions involving NADH are attractive drug targets.
