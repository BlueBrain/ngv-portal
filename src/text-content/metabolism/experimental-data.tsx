  concentrationsOfMolecules: (<p>The molecules of the brain, and in particular, metabolites, are important players of all the biochemical pathways that underlie the neuronal function. The molar concentrations are commonly used as a quantitative measure in modeling and simulation studies. This data was carefully collected from all the available resources, taking into account conditions and metadata when it was provided. In some cases, the approximations were made given the lack of data or contradictory reports coming from different sources.</p>),
