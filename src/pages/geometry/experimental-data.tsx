                A framework, called Ultraliser, is developed to create high fidelity, optimized and watertight mesh models of the NGV data that were, either obtained from the EM stacks or reconstructed by other meshing tools that cannot create watertight meshes. This framework was then used to generate polygonal mesh models of all the objects that were produced by Cali et al 2019, including four neurons, four astrocytes and their nuclei, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula and two vasculature parts.

                The skeletonization process transforms surface mesh geometries into cell morphologies. To achieve this we used constrained mean curvature flow (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03178.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tagliasacchi et al., 2012</a>), which collapsed the surface mesh geometry into a skeletal structure. The morphologies consist of points, connected via edges representing the midlines of the surface mesh. Cross-sectional information about the volume and surface area are stored at each point of the skeletonized morphology.

                A digital reconstruction of a rat cerebral vasculature dataset was produced by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2009.58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reichold et al. (2009)</a>. Cylindrical blocks of the ratâ€™s somatosensory cortex vasculature were scanned using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic imaging at the TOMCAT beamline (Swiss Light Source). High energy beams (20KeV) irradiated the tissue with a resolution of (700 nm), resulting in grayscale image stacks, which were segmented into binary images and subsequently converted into midlines (skeleton) using custom software for artifact removal and skeletonization.

                The dataset consists of point samples linked together with edges. Each point is acquired with a diameter which represents the width of the cross section. Two consecutive points constitute a segment in the morphology, and consecutive segments form a morphological section.
